# Overview

This project provides all python scripts to reproduce the results of the manuscript
"Prediction of Pore-scale Clogging Using Artificial Intelligence Algorithms" 
by Chao Lei, Mandana Samari-Kermani , Hamed Aslannejad, and Alraune Zech.

It provides the implementations of the workflows for training and testing the 
five AI algorithms:
    + Artificial Neural Network (ANN)
    + Decision Tree (DT)
    + Random Forest (FR)
    + Linear Regression (LR)
    + Support Vector Regression (SVR)  

It further provides a summary of the algorithm results and python 
scripts to reproduce all figures (in the manuscript and Supporting Information) 
based on the input data and results.
